# Linked List

In the realm of computer science, a linked list is a pivotal data structure that serves as a linear collection of data elements, referred to as nodes. Unlike arrays, the linear ordering of elements in a linked list is not determined by their physical location in memory. Rather, each node points to its successor, forming a chain-like sequence.

## Components and Types

The most basic unit of a linked list is a "node," which is typically composed of two key components:

1. **Data**: Holds the actual value.
2. **Next**: A reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

In its simplest form, a linked list is known as a **Singly Linked List**, where each node points only to the next node in line. More complex variants such as **Doubly Linked Lists** and **Circular Linked Lists** exist, where nodes may point both forwards and backwards or the last node may point back to the first, thereby creating a loop.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

-   **Dynamic Size**: The size can be adjusted during runtime.
-   **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing a node is an \(O(1)\) operation, meaning it's highly efficient.
-   **Memory Utilization**: Unlike arrays, nodes are allocated only when required, thus optimizing memory usage.

### Limitations

-   **Linear Access**: Access time to reach an element is linear, making random access infeasible.
-   **Memory Overhead**: Each node needs extra storage for the 'Next' reference, increasing the memory footprint.
-   **Poor Cache Locality**: Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous locations, leading to cache misses and slower execution times.

## Practical Applications

Linked lists are often employed in places where dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are prioritized over quick, random access to elements. This makes them highly useful in various scenarios, including implementation of stacks, queues, and even more complex data structures like hash maps and trees.
