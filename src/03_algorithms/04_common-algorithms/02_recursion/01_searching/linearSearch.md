# Linear Search

## Pseudoscope

-   the function accepts an array and a value
-   loop through the array and checks if the current array element is equal to the value
-   it it is, return the index at which the element is found
-   if the value is never found, return `-1`

## JavaScript search

-   there are many different search methods on arrays in JavaScript:
    -   `indexOf()`
    -   `includes()`
    -   `find()`
    -   `indIndex()`
