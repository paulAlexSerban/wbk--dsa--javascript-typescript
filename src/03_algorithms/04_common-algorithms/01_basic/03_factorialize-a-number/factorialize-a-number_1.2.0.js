/**
 * Factorialize a Number
 *
 * Return the factorial of the provided integer.
 * If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
 * Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!
 * For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
 * Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

/**
 * Solution 3
 * ==> using Tail Recursion
 *
 * In this solution, we use Tail Recursion 530 to optimize the the memory use.
 * In traditional head recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first, and then you take the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result. In this manner, you donâ€™t get the result of your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.
 * In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call, passing the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last statement being in the form of (return (recursive-function params)).
 * In this solution, with each evaluation of the recursive call, the factorial is updated.
 * This is different from the head-recursive solution where all evaluation calculations are stored on the stack until the base case is reached.
