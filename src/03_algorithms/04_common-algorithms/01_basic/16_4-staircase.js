 *
 * This is a staircase of size n = 4:
 *
 *     #
 *    ##
 *   ###
 *  ####
 *
 * Its base and height are both equal to n. It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
 *
 * Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase as described above.
 *
 * staircase has the following parameter(s):
 * - n: an integer
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * A single integer, n, denoting the size of the staircase.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * 0 < n <= 100

/**
 * MERN Project Ideas
 * 

### 1. Dynamic Website Design Editor

**Description**: Create a web application where users can design their web pages using basic components like buttons, divs, headers, and more. Add a feature where users can add a 'staircase' layout for text, images, or buttons.

**How the Algorithm Fits**: The staircase algorithm can be used to determine how to place each element in a staircase layout, calculating the correct amount of padding or margin around each one.


### 2. Project Management Dashboard

**Description**: Develop a project management tool where tasks can be organized in a pyramid or staircase structure based on their priority or dependency level.

**How the Algorithm Fits**: The staircase algorithm can be used to visualize tasks in a priority pyramid. The highest priority tasks could be at the top (single '#'), and lower-priority tasks can fill out the base.

---

### 3. Game Level Design Tool

**Description**: Create an online tool that allows users to design 2D game levels. Incorporate a feature where users can add staircase-shaped terrain or obstacles.

**How the Algorithm Fits**: Use the staircase algorithm to generate a preview of what the staircase-shaped terrain or obstacle would look like in the 2D grid of the game level.

---

### 4. Data Visualization Tool

**Description**: Build a tool that can visualize different types of data in various styles. Add an option to visualize data in a 'staircase' graph.

**How the Algorithm Fits**: The staircase algorithm can be used to draw the steps of a 'staircase' graph that displays data points in a unique way. For example, stock prices or temperature changes can be visualized as a staircase where each step represents a different value.

---

### 5. Employee Skill Matrix

**Description**: Create an employee skill matrix where the skill levels of different employees can be plotted in a matrix format. Use a staircase shape to represent the increasing levels of each skill for an individual.

**How the Algorithm Fits**: The staircase algorithm can be used to dynamically generate the staircase shape for each skill level. This allows managers to easily visualize and compare the skill levels of different employees.

In each of these projects, the staircase algorithm can help simplify the calculation and display of staircase-like structures, making these functionalities more efficient and easier to implement.
