/**
 * Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
 * Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array.
 * For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.
 * Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].

/**
 * Code Explanation
 * Create a variable to store the results as an array.
 * Create an outer loop to iterate through the outer array.
 * Create a second variable to hold the largest number and initialize it with the first number. This must be outside an inner loop so it wonâ€™t be reassigned until we find a larger number.
 * Create said inner loop to work with the sub-arrays.
 * Check if the element of the sub array is larger than the currently stored largest number. If so, then update the number in the variable.
 * After the inner loop, save the largest number in the corresponding position inside of the results array.
 * And finally return said array.
