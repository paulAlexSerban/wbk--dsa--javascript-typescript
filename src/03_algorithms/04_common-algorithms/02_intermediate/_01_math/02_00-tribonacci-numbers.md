# Tribonacci Sequence

The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the famous Fibonacci sequence and holds its own mathematical charm and applications. Instead of each number being the sum of its two predecessors, like in the Fibonacci sequence, each number in the Tribonacci sequence is the sum of its three predecessors.

## Definition

The Tribonacci sequence \( T(n) \) is defined as follows:

\[ T(0) = 0, \quad T(1) = 1, \quad T(2) = 1 \]
\[ T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2), \quad \text{for } n \geq 0 \]

In list form, the first few Tribonacci numbers are:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, ...`

## Example Code Implementation

Here is an example code snippet that implements the Tribonacci sequence in JavaScript. This example uses dynamic programming to build an array of Tribonacci numbers iteratively:

```javascript
var tribonacci = function (n) {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;

    const tribNumbers = [0, 1, 1];

    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        tribNumbers[i] = tribNumbers[i - 1] + tribNumbers[i - 2] + tribNumbers[i - 3];
    }

    return tribNumbers[n];
};
```

The function `tribonacci` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the \( n^{th} \) Tribonacci number.

### Test Cases

```javascript
console.log(tribonacci(4)); // Output: 4
console.log(tribonacci(25)); // Output: 1389537
```

## Applications

Although less famous than its Fibonacci counterpart, the Tribonacci sequence does show up in certain combinatorial problems and recreational mathematics. Its properties can be explored to understand more complex mathematical patterns and sequences.
