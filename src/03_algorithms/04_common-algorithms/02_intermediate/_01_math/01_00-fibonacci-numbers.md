# Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci numbers form an essential sequence in mathematics, known as the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence has historical significance and various applications across multiple fields, including computer science, art, and even nature.

## Definition

The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Thereafter, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence \( F(n) \) is defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]
\[ F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \]

In a list form, the sequence starts as follows:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

## Geometrical Interpretation

One intriguing way to visualize the Fibonacci sequence is through "Fibonacci tiles," squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers. When these squares are assembled, they form a particular type of tiling pattern.

## Fibonacci Spiral and Golden Ratio

Another fascinating aspect is the Fibonacci spiral, an approximation of the golden spiral. It is created by drawing circular arcs connecting opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling. This spiral is often used to describe patterns in nature and art.

The ratio between successive Fibonacci numbers approximates the Golden Ratio (\( \phi \)), which is approximately 1.618033988749895. This ratio is seen as aesthetically pleasing and occurs in various aspects of art, architecture, and nature.

## Applications

Fibonacci numbers have a wide range of applications, including in algorithms, financial markets, and even biological settings, where branching patterns of trees or the arrangement of leaves, petals, and fruits often follow Fibonacci numbers.
