# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

## Why learn these?

-   the basic sorting algorithms do not scale well
-   these intermediate algorithms are are much faster, but also more challenging, and less intuitive to write on your own
-   try out a bubble sort on an of 10000 elements, it will take some time

## Faster sorts

-   there is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n log n)`
-   there is a tradeoff between efficient and simplicity
-   the more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand

# Sorting

-   very important in the Computer Science topic

## What is it?

-   sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (eg. an array) so that hte items are in some kind of order
    -   sorting numbers from smallest to largest
    -   sorting names alphabetically
    -   sorting movies base on release year
    -   sorting movies based on revenue

## Why do we need to learn sorting?

-   sorting is a very common task - ao it is good to know how it works
-   there are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have theirs own advantages and disadvantages

## Big of Basic Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

-   BEST - time complexity - `O(n)`
-   AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`

### Insertion Sort

-   BEST - time complexity - `O(n)`
-   AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`

### Selection Sort

-   BEST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`

## Basic Sorting algorithms recap

-   sorting is fundamental
-   bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are roughly relevant
-   all have average time complexities that are quadratic
-   we can do better ... but we need more complex algorithms
