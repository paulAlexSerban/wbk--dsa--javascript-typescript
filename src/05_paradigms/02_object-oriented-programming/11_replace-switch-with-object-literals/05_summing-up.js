/**
 * Summing up
 *
 * Object literals are a more natural control of flow in JavaScript,
 * `switch` is a bit old and clunky and prone to difficult debugging errors.
 * Objects are more extensible, maintainable, and we can test them a lot better.
 * Theyâ€™re also part of a design pattern and very commonly used day to day
 * in other programming tasks. Object literals can contain functions
 * as well as any other Object type, which makes them really flexible!
 * Each function in the literal has function scope too, so we can return
 * the closure from the parent function we invoke (in this case getDrink
 * returns the closure).
