# The Big O Notation

-   it is a way of generalizing code and talking about it and comparing code ind its performance to other pieces of code;

## Who cares and why

-   it is important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how your code performs;
-   it is useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches - because often is not as cut and ry as it may seem - it is not that one solution is always great and the other is always terrible
-   to point out the tradeoffs
-   when your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts od the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in out application - it helps us find inefficient points
-   LESS IMPORTANT: it comes up in interviews
