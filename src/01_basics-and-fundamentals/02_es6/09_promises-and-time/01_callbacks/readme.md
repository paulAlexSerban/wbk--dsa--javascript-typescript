# Callback functions

-   Function Sequence

*   JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined.

-   JavaScript Callbacks

*   A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

-   When to Use a Callback?

*   Callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load)
