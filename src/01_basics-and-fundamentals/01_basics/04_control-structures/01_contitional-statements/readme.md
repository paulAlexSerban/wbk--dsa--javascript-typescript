Conditional Statements
if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```js
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

if...else statement: Adds an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

```js
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

if...else if...else statement: Tests several conditions and executes the block of code for the first condition that is true.

```js
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if no conditions are true
}
```

switch statement: Checks a value against multiple cases and executes the associated block of code.

```js
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value2
        break;
    default:
    // code to be executed if none of the cases match
}
```
