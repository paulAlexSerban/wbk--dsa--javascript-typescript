Looping Structures
for loop: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

```js
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed each loop iteration
}
```

while loop: Repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.

```js
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed each loop iteration
}
```

do...while loop: Repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true, but the block is executed at least once because the condition is tested after the block is executed.

```js
do {
    // code to be executed each loop iteration
} while (condition);
```

for...in loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.

```js
for (var property in object) {
    // code to be executed each loop iteration
}
```

for...of loop: Iterates over the values in an iterable object, like an array or a string.

```js
for (var value of iterable) {
    // code to be executed each loop iteration
}
```
