# Scope

## What exactly is Scope?

Scope refers to the area where an item (such as a function or variable) is visible and accessible to other code.

Note:

Scope means area, space, or region.
Global scope means global space or a public space.
Local scope means a local region or a restricted region.

-   Variables defined in global scope are available everywhere in the application.
-   In a module, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicitly exported.
-   Function scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within the function
-   Variables declared with let and const have block scope. var doesnâ€™t have block scope.
