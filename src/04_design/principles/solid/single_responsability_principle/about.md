# Single Responsibility Principle SRP

The **Single-Responsibility Principle** (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

It is bad idea to add more than responsibility to one module, class or function.

The **Single Responsibility Principle** is the exact opposite if the **God Object** anti-pattern, the huge massive class that has lots of responsibilities, lots of spaghetti code, very difficult to figure out what it does and how it is working.

The **Single Responsibility Principle** is the idea that you basically have to have just one RESPONSIBILITY and id you need additional responsibility, then just make more classes
