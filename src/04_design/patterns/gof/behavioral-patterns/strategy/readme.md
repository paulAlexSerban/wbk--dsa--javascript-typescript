# Strategy Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them into separate classes, and make them interchangeable. The pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## The key components of the Strategy design pattern are:

1. Context: The class that uses the strategy objects. It maintains a reference to the strategy object and can replace the strategy at runtime.
2. Strategy Interface: The common interface implemented by all concrete strategy classes. It defines the method that the context class will use to delegate the task.
3. Concrete Strategies: These classes implement the strategy interface and provide different implementations of the algorithm.

## Here are five use cases for the Strategy design pattern:

1. Payment Processing: Implement different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) as separate strategy classes. The context class can then choose the appropriate strategy based on user selection or business rules.
2. Compression Algorithms: Create different compression algorithms (e.g., ZIP, RAR, TAR) as strategy classes, and allow users to choose the algorithm they want to use for compressing their files.
3. Image Filters: Develop a photo editing application that applies various filters (e.g., black and white, sepia, blur) to images. Create different filter algorithms as strategy classes, and let users select the filter they want to apply.
4. Sorting Algorithms: In a data processing application, provide different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, bubble sort) as strategy classes. The application can then choose the most suitable sorting algorithm based on the input data.
5. Route Planning: In a navigation application, create different route planning algorithms (e.g., shortest distance, fastest time, least fuel consumption) as strategy classes. Users can then choose the algorithm they prefer to calculate the best route.
