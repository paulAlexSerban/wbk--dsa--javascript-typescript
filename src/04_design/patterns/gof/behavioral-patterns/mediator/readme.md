# Mediator Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by having a central hub, called a mediator, that handles communication between them. By doing so, the pattern ensures that objects don't communicate directly with each other, but instead, they communicate through the mediator. This makes it easier to change and maintain the relationships between objects.

## Key components of the Mediator design pattern:

1. Mediator: This is the central hub responsible for handling communication between objects. It defines the interface for communication between the Colleague objects.

2. Concrete Mediator: This is an implementation of the Mediator interface, which coordinates communication between the Colleague objects.

3. Colleague: This is the base class or interface for the objects that need to communicate with each other. Colleagues are aware of the mediator but don't communicate directly with each other.

4. Concrete Colleague: This is an implementation of the Colleague class or interface. Each Concrete Colleague communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.

## 5 Use Cases of the Mediator design pattern:

1. Chat application: In a chat application, the mediator can be used to manage communication between users. It can handle tasks like broadcasting messages to all users in a chat room or sending direct messages between users.

2. Air traffic control system: In an air traffic control system, the mediator can manage communication between airplanes and the control tower. It ensures that proper communication channels are established and maintained, without the airplanes needing to communicate directly with each other.

3. GUI components: In a graphical user interface (GUI), a mediator can be used to handle communication between different GUI components, like buttons, text fields, and checkboxes. It simplifies the interactions between the components and makes it easier to modify or add new components.

4. Workflow management: A mediator can be used to manage communication between different stages of a workflow process, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order and that the proper data is passed between stages.

5. Online gaming: In an online gaming environment, the mediator can manage communication between players, game servers, and other game-related systems. It can handle tasks like player registration, game state synchronization, and broadcasting game events to all connected players.
