# Observer Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object, known as the subject, to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers. It notifies the observers automatically of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods. The pattern promotes loose coupling between objects and is particularly useful when you need to update multiple objects based on a change in another object.

## Key components of the Observer pattern:

1. Subject: The object that maintains a list of its observers and provides methods for attaching and detaching observers from the list.
2. Observer: Defines an interface for objects that need to be notified of changes in the subject.
3. Concrete Subject: The actual subject that stores the state of interest to the observers. When a change occurs, it notifies all registered observers.
4. Concrete Observer: Implements the Observer interface and updates its state based on the state of the subject.

## 5 use cases of the Observer design pattern:

1. GUI components: In graphical user interfaces, components like buttons, text fields, and checkboxes can be observed by other components, such as panels or windows, that need to react to user actions.
2. Notifications and alerts: Social media platforms or messaging apps can use the Observer pattern to notify users when new messages or updates are available.
3. Stock market monitoring: A stock market application can use the Observer pattern to notify investors when a stock reaches a certain price or when there's a significant market event.
4. Sensor data monitoring: A weather monitoring system can use the Observer pattern to update various displays and components when new sensor data is received.
5. Progress tracking: In a project management application, the Observer pattern can be used to automatically update progress indicators, charts, or reports when a task is completed or modified.
