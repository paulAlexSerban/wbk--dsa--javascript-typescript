# Template Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class (or an interface) but lets derived classes override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This pattern allows you to reuse code and provides a way to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its structure.

## The key components of the Template Method design pattern are:

1. Abstract Class (or Interface): This defines the template method, which outlines the structure of the algorithm. It can also include some common functionality and abstract methods that the derived classes must implement.
2. Concrete Classes: These classes inherit from the abstract class (or implement the interface) and provide the implementation for the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.

## Here are five use cases for the Template Method design pattern:

1. Data Importers: In an application that supports importing data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON), the Template Method pattern can be used to outline the common steps (e.g., reading the file, parsing data, validation, and saving to the database) while allowing derived classes to handle format-specific parsing and validation logic.
2. Report Generation: In a reporting application, you can use the Template Method pattern to define the general structure of a report (e.g., header, body, footer) while allowing derived classes to implement the specific content and formatting for different types of reports.
3. Web Page Rendering: In a web application, the Template Method pattern can be used to define the common structure of a web page (e.g., header, navigation, content, footer) while allowing derived classes to provide the content and styling for specific pages or page types.
4. Data Processing Pipelines: In a data processing application, the Template Method pattern can be used to define the common steps of a processing pipeline (e.g., data acquisition, preprocessing, processing, post-processing, and storage) while allowing derived classes to implement the specifics of each step for different types of data or processing algorithms.
5. User Authentication: In an application that supports multiple authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth, two-factor authentication), the Template Method pattern can be used to define the common steps for user authentication (e.g., input validation, authentication, and authorization) while allowing derived classes to handle the specifics of each authentication method.
