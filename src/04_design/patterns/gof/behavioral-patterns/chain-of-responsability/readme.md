The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables decoupling the sender of a request from its receiver. The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request, creating a chain of potential handlers. Each handler in the chain decides whether to process the request, pass it along to the next handler, or both.

The primary components of the Chain of Responsibility pattern are:

1. Handler: An interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for handling requests. It usually includes a method to set the next handler in the chain.

2. Concrete Handler: A class that implements the Handler interface or extends the abstract Handler class. It is responsible for handling the request or passing it along to the next handler in the chain.

3. Client: The entity that initiates the request. The client is not aware of the specific handlers in the chain and only interacts with the first handler.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is particularly useful when:

-   You have multiple objects that can handle a request, and the handler should be determined at runtime.
-   You want to avoid tight coupling between the sender and the receiver of the request.
-   You want to allow for the dynamic addition or removal of handlers from the chain.

Example use cases of the Chain of Responsibility pattern include:

-   Logging systems, where different loggers handle different log levels.
-   Authentication and authorization, where various middleware components can process, modify, or reject incoming requests.
-   GUI event handling, where multiple components may respond to user interactions.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns, making it easier to add, modify, or remove handlers without affecting the overall system. However, it can also introduce complexity and may lead to reduced performance if the chain becomes too long or if handlers perform expensive operations.
