Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects. These patterns define how objects collaborate to accomplish a specific task while keeping their individual responsibilities separate. This separation of concerns helps make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

Here is an overview of some common behavioral design patterns:

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: This pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request by forming a chain of objects. The request is passed along the chain until an object handles it. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from the receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

2. **Command**: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations. It separates the object that invokes an operation from the object that knows how to perform that operation.

3. **Interpreter**: This pattern provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions by representing the grammar rules as objects and using a composite pattern to build an abstract syntax tree representing the input. The Interpreter pattern is used for parsing and processing domain-specific languages, simple expressions, or structured text data.

4. **Iterator**: The Iterator pattern provides a standard way to traverse a collection of items without exposing the underlying representation. It defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements in a collection, allowing clients to iterate through the collection without knowing the specific implementation details.

5. **Mediator**: The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects by encapsulating the way objects interact and communicate with each other. It defines an object that acts as an intermediary between other objects, facilitating communication and reducing direct dependencies between them.

6. **Memento**: This pattern provides a way to capture and store an object's internal state, allowing the object to be restored to that state at a later time. The Memento pattern is used to implement undo and redo functionality, save points, or snapshots of an object's state.

7. **Observer**: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful for implementing event-driven systems or for keeping multiple views of the same data in sync.

8. **State**: The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It represents the different states as separate objects and defines a context object that maintains a reference to the current state object. This pattern is useful for managing complex state transitions or when an object's behavior depends on its state.

9. **Strategy**: The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows clients to choose the algorithm they want to use at runtime, promoting flexibility and separation of concerns.

10. **Template Method**: The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall algorithm's structure. This pattern promotes code reuse and provides a way to define a common algorithm structure while deferring some implementation details to subclasses.

11. **Visitor**: The Visitor pattern allows for the separation of an algorithm from the object structure it operates on. It defines a visitor object that implements a specific operation on the object structure, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the object structure or the individual elements.
