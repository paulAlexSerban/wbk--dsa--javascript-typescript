# State Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern suggests creating separate state classes to represent different states of the object and encapsulate the behavior corresponding to each state.

## The main components of the State design pattern are:

1. Context: The class that holds the reference to the current state and delegates the behavior to the state object.
2. State Interface or Abstract State: An interface or abstract class defining the common behavior for all concrete states.
3. Concrete States: The classes implementing the State interface or inheriting from the abstract state class, representing specific object states, and providing the corresponding behavior.

## Here are 5 use cases for the State design pattern:

1. Vending Machines: The State design pattern can be used to represent different states of a vending machine, such as "idle", "dispensing item", "out of stock", or "awaiting payment", each with their own unique behavior.
2. Video Game Characters: In video games, characters might have different states such as "idle", "walking", "running", "attacking", or "jumping". The State design pattern can be used to manage the character's behavior based on their current state.
3. Traffic Light System: The State design pattern can be applied to a traffic light system, where each traffic light has different states like "red", "yellow", and "green", with different behaviors and durations.
4. Document Workflow: In a document management system, a document can have different states such as "draft", "submitted for review", "approved", or "rejected". The State pattern can be used to manage the behavior of the document in each state, like defining the allowed actions and transitions between states.
5. Media Player: A media player application can have states such as "playing", "paused", "stopped", or "buffering". The State design pattern can be used to manage the behavior of the media player depending on its current state, like defining the allowed actions (e.g., play, pause, stop) and updating the user interface.
