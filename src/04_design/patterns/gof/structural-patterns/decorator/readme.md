# Decorator Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

The decorator design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows adding new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure. It involves a set of decorator classes that mirror the type of the objects they extend (they have the same interface) but add or override behavior.

## The key components of the decorator design pattern are:

1. Component: An abstract class or interface that defines the common properties and methods for both the objects being extended and the decorators.
2. Concrete Component: A class that implements the Component interface. This is the base object that can be extended by decorators.
3. Decorator: An abstract class or interface that also implements the Component interface. It has a reference to a Component object and can add or override the behavior of the object it wraps.
4. Concrete Decorator: A class that extends the Decorator class. It adds or overrides specific behavior of the Concrete Component.

## Here are five use cases for the decorator design pattern:

1. Graphic User Interface (GUI) components: The decorator pattern can be used to add functionality to GUI components like text boxes, buttons, or panels. You can create decorators that add features like borders, tooltips, or scrollbars without modifying the original component class.
2. Logging and instrumentation: The decorator pattern can be applied to add logging or instrumentation features to existing classes. For example, you can create a decorator that logs method calls, measures execution time, or counts the number of times a method is called.
3. Caching and memoization: You can use the decorator pattern to add caching or memoization features to existing classes. By creating a decorator that caches the results of method calls, you can improve the performance of methods that have expensive computations or involve slow resources like databases or APIs.
4. Access control and validation: The decorator pattern can be used to add access control or validation to existing classes. You can create decorators that check user permissions before allowing method calls or validate input parameters before passing them to the original object.
5. Compression and encryption: The decorator pattern can be applied to add compression or encryption features to existing classes. For example, you can create a decorator that compresses data before writing it to a file or encrypts it before sending it over a network.
