# Adapter Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

The adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between the two interfaces by providing a compatible interface that converts the calls from one interface to the other. This pattern is useful when you want to integrate existing components or libraries without modifying their code.

## Key components of the adapter design pattern:

1. Target: The interface that the client expects to work with.
2. Adapter: The class that implements the Target interface and encapsulates the Adaptee, converting the Target interface calls to Adaptee methods.
3. Adaptee: The existing class or interface that needs to be adapted to work with the Target interface.
4. Client: The class that interacts with the Target interface, unaware of the Adapter and Adaptee.

## Five use cases of the adapter design pattern:

1. Integrating legacy systems: When integrating a legacy system with a new system, the adapter pattern can be used to create a compatible interface between the two systems, enabling them to work together without modifying the legacy system's code.
2. Third-party library integration: When using a third-party library that has a different interface than your application expects, the adapter pattern can be used to create a compatible interface that allows your application to interact with the library seamlessly.
3. Cross-platform support: In a cross-platform application, the adapter pattern can be used to create platform-specific implementations of a common interface, allowing the application to run on different platforms without changing the core code.
4. API versioning: When migrating to a new version of an API with breaking changes, the adapter pattern can be used to create a compatibility layer between the old and new API versions, enabling a gradual migration process without disrupting the existing application functionality.
5. Plug-ins and extensions: The adapter pattern can be used in plug-in and extension systems to create a common interface for all plug-ins or extensions, allowing them to interact with the main application regardless of their underlying implementation. This simplifies the process of integrating new plug-ins or extensions into the application.
