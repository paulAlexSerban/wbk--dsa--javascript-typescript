Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns help in creating larger structures while keeping the individual components flexible and reusable. Structural design patterns focus on simplifying complex relationships between objects and establishing clear communication among them.

Here is an overview of some common structural design patterns:

1. **Adapter**: The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is useful when you need to make classes with incompatible interfaces work together without modifying their source code.

2. **Bridge**: The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to separate an abstraction's interface from its implementation, especially if the implementation details need to be changed or extended independently.

3. **Composite**: The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is useful when you need to work with a hierarchy of objects that have a common interface or when you want to simplify the handling of complex object structures.

4. **Decorator**: The Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It involves wrapping an object with a decorator object that adds or overrides the original object's behavior. This pattern is useful when you need to extend an object's functionality dynamically without modifying its structure or when subclassing is not feasible.

5. **Facade**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It involves creating a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexities and dependencies. This pattern is useful when you want to provide a simple interface for clients to interact with a complex subsystem or when you need to decouple clients from the subsystem's components.

6. **Flyweight**: The Flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It involves using a shared pool of objects with a common state and creating new objects by providing only the unique or extrinsic state. This pattern is useful when you need to manage a large number of objects with similar state and reduce memory overhead.

7. **Proxy**: The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It involves creating a new object (proxy) that has the same interface as the original object and forwards requests to the original object. This pattern is useful when you need to add a level of indirection or control to the access of an object, such as adding caching, logging, or access control.

Each of these structural design patterns addresses specific aspects of object composition and communication. By using these patterns, you can simplify complex object relationships, promote flexibility, and create reusable components in your code.
