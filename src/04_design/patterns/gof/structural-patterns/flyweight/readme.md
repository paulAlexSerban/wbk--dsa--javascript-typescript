# Flyweight Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage and improving performance by sharing as much data as possible among similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have some shared properties.

## Key Components:

1. Flyweight: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the common properties and methods for the shared objects.
2. Concrete Flyweight: This class implements the Flyweight interface and represents the actual shared objects. It stores the intrinsic state (shared properties) and provides methods to manipulate the extrinsic state (non-shared properties).
3. Flyweight Factory: This class is responsible for creating and managing the flyweight objects. It ensures that the existing flyweight objects are reused and new ones are only created when necessary.
4. Client: This is the class that interacts with the Flyweight objects. It stores the extrinsic states and passes them to the flyweight objects when needed.

## 5 Use Cases:

1. Text Editor: A text editor that handles large documents can use the Flyweight pattern to minimize memory usage by sharing common properties like font, size, and style among similar text elements.
2. Game Characters: In a video game with many characters, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share common attributes like character models, textures, and animations, while storing unique properties like position and health separately.
3. Geographic Information System (GIS): A GIS application can use the Flyweight pattern to share common properties like map tiles, symbols, and colors among similar geographic elements, while storing unique properties like coordinates and metadata separately.
4. Image Processing: When dealing with a large number of image objects in an image processing application, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share common properties like filters, color palettes, and transformations among similar images, while storing unique properties like pixel data separately.
5. UI Elements: In a GUI application with many UI elements, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share common properties like appearance, event handlers, and layout constraints among similar UI elements, while storing unique properties like position and size separately.
