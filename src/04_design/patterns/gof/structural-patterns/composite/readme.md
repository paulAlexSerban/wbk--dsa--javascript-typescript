# Composite Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

The composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object. It enables you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The composite pattern provides a way to work with these objects uniformly.

## The main components of the composite design pattern are:

1. Component: An abstract class or interface that defines the common properties and methods for all the objects in the composition. It can include methods to add, remove, or access child components.
2. Leaf: A class that represents the basic elements or individual objects in the composition. It implements the Component interface and doesn't have any children.
3. Composite: A class that represents complex objects that can have children. It implements the Component interface and maintains a list of its children.
4. Client: A class that interacts with the Component interface to perform operations on the composite structures.

## Here are five use cases for the composite design pattern:

1. File system: A file system can be represented using the composite pattern, where folders can contain files or other folders. A file (Leaf) can't contain other files or folders, whereas a folder (Composite) can. The Component interface can provide methods to perform common operations like renaming, moving, or deleting files and folders.
2. Graphical user interface (GUI): The composite pattern can be used to design GUI frameworks, where UI elements can be composed to create complex interfaces. For example, a panel (Composite) can contain buttons (Leaf), text boxes (Leaf), or other panels (Composite), and the Component interface provides methods to render, resize, or interact with the UI elements.
3. Organizational structure: An organizational hierarchy can be modeled using the composite pattern. Employees (Leaf) can be part of teams or departments (Composite), and departments can be part of larger divisions (Composite). The Component interface can provide methods to calculate total salary, find team members, or get the manager of a department.
4. Menu system: A menu system for an application can be designed using the composite pattern. Menu items (Leaf) can be part of submenus (Composite), and submenus can be part of the main menu (Composite). The Component interface can provide methods to add, remove, or access menu items and submenus.
5. Rendering engine: A rendering engine for a game or 3D application can use the composite pattern to organize objects in a scene. A simple object (Leaf) can be part of a more complex object (Composite), and complex objects can be part of even more complex objects (Composite). The Component interface can provide methods to update, draw, or transform the objects in the scene.
